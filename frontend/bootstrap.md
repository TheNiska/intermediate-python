# Bootstrap grid

Bootstrap uses 12-columns grid system. It has a container, rows and columns. The container is the root element of the grid. Syntax is __col-<break-point>-<space in columns>__. For example, we can write a style for a column that takes 50% of the space for large screens and takes 100% of the space for other screens. This will be: __col-12 col-lg-6__.
