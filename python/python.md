- Python uses MRO (method resolution order) to inherit methods in correct order. We can uses method mro() to check the order of inheritance.  
- Python have __global__ and __nonlocal__ keywords and __globals__ and __locals__ functions.  

## OOP Concepts
# Inheritance
- Inheritance is the capability of one class to derive or inherit the properties from another class. The class that derives properties is called the derived class or child class and the class from which the properties are being derived is called the base class or parent class.
# Polymorphism
- It'a an ability of a method to have many different forms.Subclasses can override methods defined in their parent class to provide specific behavior.
# Encapsulation
- It describes the idea of wrapping data and the methods that work on data within one unit. This puts restrictions on accessing variables and methods directly and can prevent the accidental modification of data. To prevent accidental change, an object’s variable can only be changed by an object’s method. Those types of variables are known as private variables.
# Abstraction
- The main idea is to hide unnecessary code details from the user.
